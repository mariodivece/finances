# Double-Entry Accounting

Double-entry accounting is a fundamental accounting method that records each financial transaction in at least two different accounts, ensuring that the accounting equation remains balanced. It is based on the principle that every transaction has both a debit and a credit entry, with the total debits equaling the total credits.

Here's how double-entry accounting works:

Debits and Credits:

In double-entry accounting, every transaction is recorded using both a debit and a credit entry.
Debits and credits represent increases or decreases in different types of accounts. The terms "debit" and "credit" don't necessarily mean an increase or decrease in value but rather refer to which side of the account is affected by a transaction.
Accounting Equation:

The foundation of double-entry accounting is the accounting equation, which states that assets equal liabilities plus equity.
This equation must remain balanced after each transaction. In other words, the total debits must equal the total credits for every transaction.
Types of Accounts:

There are five main types of accounts in double-entry accounting: assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses.
Asset accounts typically have a debit balance, while liability and equity accounts have a credit balance.
Revenue accounts have a credit balance, while expense accounts have a debit balance.
Examples:

For example, when a company sells a product for cash, it records a debit to the cash account (an increase in cash) and a credit to the revenue account (an increase in revenue).
Similarly, when a company purchases inventory on credit, it records a debit to the inventory account (an increase in inventory) and a credit to the accounts payable account (an increase in liabilities).
Trial Balance:

At the end of an accounting period, all the debit and credit entries are totaled and compared in a trial balance.
If the total debits equal the total credits in the trial balance, it indicates that the books are balanced, and the accounting equation is satisfied.
Double-entry accounting provides several benefits, including accuracy, completeness, and the ability to detect errors and discrepancies. It ensures that every transaction is properly recorded and that the financial statements accurately reflect the financial position and performance of an organization.

## Examples of double-entry accounting

Cash Sale Transaction:

Suppose a retail store sells merchandise for cash. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Cash (to increase the cash account)
Credit: Sales Revenue (to increase revenue)
Credit Sale Transaction:

Now, let's say the same retail store sells merchandise on credit to a customer. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Accounts Receivable (to increase the accounts receivable account)
Credit: Sales Revenue (to increase revenue)
Inventory Purchase Transaction:

Suppose the retail store purchases inventory on credit from a supplier. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Inventory (to increase the inventory account)
Credit: Accounts Payable (to increase the accounts payable account)
Payment of Expenses Transaction:

Let's say the retail store pays rent for its premises. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Rent Expense (to increase the expense account)
Credit: Cash (to decrease the cash account)
Investment by Owner Transaction:

Suppose the owner invests additional funds into the business. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Cash (to increase the cash account)
Credit: Owner's Equity (to increase the owner's equity account)
Loan Repayment Transaction:

Let's say the business repays a portion of its loan. The transaction would be recorded as follows:
Debit: Loan Payable (to decrease the loan payable account)
Credit: Cash (to decrease the cash account)
These examples demonstrate how each transaction affects at least two accounts, with one account being debited and another being credited. This ensures that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + equity) remains balanced after each transaction. Double-entry accounting provides a systematic way to accurately record financial transactions and maintain the integrity of financial records.
