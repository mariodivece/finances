The difference between accrual basis and cash basis accounting lies in how and when revenues and expenses are recognized in the financial statements:

## Accrual Basis Accounting:

Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid.
Revenues are recognized when they are earned, meaning when goods are delivered or services are performed, regardless of when payment is received.
Expenses are recognized when they are incurred, meaning when goods or services are received, regardless of when payment is made.
Accrual basis accounting provides a more accurate depiction of a company's financial performance and position over a given period because it matches revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues.

## Cash Basis Accounting:

Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues and expenses are recorded only when cash is received or paid, regardless of when the revenue is earned or the expenses are incurred.
Revenues are recognized when cash is received, regardless of when goods are delivered or services are performed.
Expenses are recognized when cash is paid, regardless of when goods or services are received.
Cash basis accounting is simpler and easier to understand but may not provide an accurate representation of a company's financial performance and position, especially for businesses with significant transactions that occur over extended periods.

## Key Differences

Here are some key differences between accrual basis and cash basis accounting:

### Timing of Recognition:
Accrual basis recognizes revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred, while cash basis recognizes them when cash is received or paid.

### Matching Principle:
Accrual basis follows the matching principle, which matches revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues. Cash basis does not adhere to the matching principle.
Accuracy: Accrual basis provides a more accurate representation of financial performance and position over a given period, while cash basis may not accurately reflect the timing of transactions.

### Complexity:
Accrual basis accounting tends to be more complex than cash basis accounting due to the need to track receivables, payables, and accruals.

### GAAP Compliance:
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require most businesses to use accrual basis accounting, especially those that have significant operations or are publicly traded. Cash basis accounting is generally not compliant with GAAP.

In summary, accrual basis accounting provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of a company's financial performance and position, while cash basis accounting is simpler but may not provide an accurate representation, particularly for businesses with complex transactions.
