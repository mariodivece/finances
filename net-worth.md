# Net Worth

Net worth is calculated by subtracting an individual's total liabilities (debts and obligations) from their total assets (what they own). In mathematical terms, the formula for calculating net worth is:

Net Worth
=
Total Assets
−
Total Liabilities
Net Worth=Total Assets−Total Liabilities

Here's a breakdown of how each component is determined:

Total Assets: These are the items of value that an individual owns. They can include:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: This includes money in checking accounts, savings accounts, and cash on hand.
Investments: Such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts (e.g., 401(k), IRA), and other securities.
Real Estate: The current market value of properties owned, including primary residence, rental properties, land, and commercial real estate.
Vehicles: The current market value of cars, boats, motorcycles, or other vehicles owned.
Personal Property: Value of valuable items such as jewelry, art, collectibles, furniture, electronics, and other possessions.
Business Ownership: Value of ownership stake in businesses, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, or shares in corporations.
Total Liabilities: These are the debts and financial obligations that an individual owes. They can include:

Mortgages: Outstanding balances on home loans or mortgages.
Auto Loans: Outstanding balances on car loans or leases.
Student Loans: Amounts owed for education loans.
Credit Card Debt: Balances owed on credit cards.
Personal Loans: Any other loans or lines of credit, such as personal loans or payday loans.
Other Liabilities: Any other financial obligations, such as medical bills, taxes owed, or outstanding bills.
Once you have determined the total value of your assets and liabilities, you can subtract the total liabilities from the total assets to calculate your net worth. A positive net worth indicates that your assets exceed your liabilities, while a negative net worth indicates that your liabilities exceed your assets.

Calculating net worth is an important financial metric that can help individuals assess their financial health, track their progress towards financial goals, and make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. It's recommended to periodically review and update your net worth calculation to reflect changes in your financial situation over time.

## Classes of Individuals (Global)

Net worth is often used as a measure to categorize individuals into different wealth classes or categories. While these classifications can vary depending on the context and the organization using them, here are some common classifications of net worth individuals:

Ultra-High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs):

Ultra-high net worth individuals are individuals with an even higher level of wealth than HNWIs.
The threshold for classifying someone as an ultra-high net worth individual can vary but is typically set at a net worth of $30 million or more, excluding the value of their primary residence.
UHNWIs often have significant assets across multiple asset classes, including real estate, stocks, bonds, private equity, and alternative investments. They may also have access to exclusive wealth management services and opportunities.

High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs):

High net worth individuals are typically defined as individuals with a substantial level of wealth, usually above a certain threshold.
The threshold for classifying someone as a high net worth individual can vary by country or organization but is often set at a net worth of $1 million or more, excluding the value of their primary residence.
HNWIs often have diverse investment portfolios, own multiple properties, and have access to various financial services and investment opportunities.

Affluent Individuals:

Affluent individuals have above-average levels of wealth but may not meet the criteria to be classified as high net worth or ultra-high net worth.
While there is no strict threshold for defining affluent individuals, they typically have a comfortable level of financial security and may own significant assets such as homes, investments, and retirement accounts.
Middle-Class Individuals:

Middle-class individuals have a moderate level of wealth and income compared to the broader population.
The definition of the middle class can vary widely depending on factors such as location, cost of living, and household income. Middle-class individuals typically have stable employment, own homes, and may have some savings and investments but may not have significant wealth or assets.
Lower-Income Individuals:

Lower-income individuals have limited financial resources and may struggle to meet their basic needs.
This category includes individuals who earn low wages, have limited access to education and job opportunities, and may rely on government assistance programs for support.
These classifications are used by financial institutions, wealth management firms, government agencies, and researchers to analyze economic trends, target specific customer segments, and design financial products and services tailored to different wealth levels.
