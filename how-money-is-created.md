# How is Money Created?

So, money doesn't just magically appear out of thin air, but it's also not something that's dug up from the ground like gold. Instead, money is created by a process called "money creation" or "money supply."

Here's how it works:

Central Banks: Every country has a central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in Europe. These central banks are responsible for managing the country's money supply and ensuring its stability.

Reserve Requirements: Banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve. This is to ensure that they have enough money on hand to cover withdrawals by customers.

Fractional Reserve Banking: Banks use a system called fractional reserve banking. This means that they only keep a fraction of the money deposited by customers in reserve. The rest of the money is lent out to borrowers or invested in other assets.

Loans and Credit: When a bank makes a loan, it doesn't actually lend out the money that's been deposited by its customers. Instead, it creates new money by crediting the borrower's account with the loan amount. This new money enters circulation and increases the overall money supply.

Multiplier Effect: This process of banks creating new money through lending is called the multiplier effect. It means that a single deposit can lead to multiple loans and multiple increases in the money supply.

So, in a nutshell, money is created through a combination of central bank policies, fractional reserve banking, and the lending activities of commercial banks. It's a bit complex, but that's the basic idea!
