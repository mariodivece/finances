Calculating federal business taxes involves several steps and depends on the type of business entity, its taxable income, deductions, credits, and other factors. Here's an overview of how federal business taxes are calculated for different types of business entities:

Sole Proprietorship and Single-Member LLC:

Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs report their business income and expenses on Schedule C of their personal income tax return (Form 1040).
Taxable income is calculated by subtracting business expenses from business income.
The net income from Schedule C is then subject to federal income tax at the individual taxpayer's marginal tax rate, which is determined by their total taxable income.
Additionally, self-employment tax is calculated on the net income, which includes both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Estimated tax payments may be required if the tax liability is expected to exceed a certain threshold.
Partnership and Multi-Member LLC:

Partnerships and multi-member LLCs do not pay income tax at the entity level. Instead, the profits and losses are "passed through" to the individual partners or members.
Each partner or member receives a Schedule K-1, which reports their share of the partnership's income, deductions, credits, etc.
Partners or members report their share of partnership income on their personal income tax returns (Form 1040) and pay taxes at their individual tax rates.
C Corporation:

C corporations are separate legal entities and pay corporate income tax on their taxable income.
Taxable income is calculated by subtracting allowable deductions from gross income.
C corporations are subject to a flat corporate tax rate, which can vary depending on the level of taxable income. As of 2022, the corporate tax rate is 21% for most corporations.
Additionally, C corporations may be subject to other taxes, such as the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) or the Personal Holding Company Tax.
Estimated tax payments may be required throughout the year.
S Corporation:

S corporations are pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, similar to partnerships.
S corporations file an informational tax return (Form 1120-S), but they do not pay income tax at the entity level.
Instead, shareholders report their share of the corporation's income, deductions, credits, etc., on their personal income tax returns (Form 1040) and pay taxes at their individual tax rates.
Limited Liability Company (LLC) taxed as a Corporation:

If an LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation, it will be treated similarly to a C corporation for federal income tax purposes.
The LLC will file a corporate tax return (Form 1120) and pay corporate income tax on its taxable income at the applicable corporate tax rate.
